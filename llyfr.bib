@article{WhittleSmoothing,
issn = {0035-9246},
abstract = {We consider the estimation of a probability density function by linear smoothing of the observed density. A basis for estimation is obtained by assuming that the ordinates of the true density function have a prior distribution such that adjacent ordinates are highly correlated. An equation determining the optimum weighting function under these circumstances is derived, and solved in special cases. The properties of the estimate are discussed and the asymptotic behaviour of its mean squared deviation D2 given. It is shown that as the sample size N increases, D2 cannot decrease faster than N-1.},

All estimates of the density function satisfying relatively mild conditions are shown to be biased. The asymptotic mean square error of a particular class of estimates is evaluated.},

@article{SheatherBandwidth,
issn = {0035-9246},
abstract = {We present a new method for data-based selection of the bandwidth in kernel density estimation which has excellent properties. It improves on a recent procedure of Park and Marron (which itself is a good method) in various ways. First, the new method has superior theoretical performance; second, it also has a computational advantage; third, the new method has reliably good performance for smooth densities in simulations, performance that is second to none in the existing literature. These methods are based on choosing the bandwidth to (approximately) minimize good quality estimates of the mean integrated squared error. The key to the success of the current procedure is the reintroduction of a non-stochastic term which was previously omitted together with use of the bandwidth to reduce bias in estimation without inflating variance.},
